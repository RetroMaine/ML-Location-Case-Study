## Project Overview:
# Summary:
You will be tasked with creating a location-based analytics web application which will prompt a user to input a location via ZIP code or an interactive pinpointing component. The application will then respond with insights regarding housing prices, crime rates, local weather patterns, and infrastructure quality based on machine learning model predictions your team will generate using relevant datasets. This project will introduce you to core concepts in basic machine learning and data visualization, as well as full-stack web development.
The backend will leverage data and machine learning models to make predictions. The frontend will present this information in a user-friendly, interactive dashboard.
This project is a great way to learn how to combine data science, machine learning, and some web development to create an impactful and informative tool regarding living conditions.
# Basic Terminology to know:
Machine Learning: Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on enabling computers and machines to imitate the way that humans learn, to perform tasks autonomously, and to improve their performance and accuracy through experience and exposure to more data. There are supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning models, but for the purposes of this project we will be focusing on supervised learning: Which develops a predictive model based on both input and output data. Examples of supervised machine learning models would be Linear Regression, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.
Frontend: This refers to the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website.
Possible technologies involve using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript or frameworks such as React.js (recommended), Angular.js, Vue.js, Svelte, etc. For this project the front-end will be a smaller aspect but still important for effectively displaying model predictions and results to the user based off of their inputted data. This is a great opportunity to show unique and engaging data visualizations if time permits.
Backend: A critical component of a web application or website that operates behind the scenes to manage and process data, as well as handle the core logic and functionality. It is responsible for various tasks that enable the frontend (the user interface) and the server to interact and deliver a seamless user experience. Some possible frameworks to use for the backend are Flask, FastAPI, or Django. This project's backend will consist of the models making predictions that will need to be communicated to the user via the dashboard.
